# AETHER 🦞✨
### **Autonomous Evolving Thought-Hierarchy Engine & Router**

**AETHER** is a high-performance, self-learning neural context engine designed for autonomous AI agents. It transforms static configuration files and logs into a dynamic, physics-based knowledge graph.

## 🚀 The Vision
Most agents treat context as a flat list of files. AETHER treats it as an **organism**. It doesn't just store data; it learns the **synapses** (relationships) between concepts based on real-time activation patterns.

## 🧠 Core Features
- **Self-Learning Synapses**: Automatically tracks which context nodes are accessed together and increases their relational "weight."
- **Modular Storage Layer**: Agnostic backend support. Use `SqliteProvider` for local performance or `JsonProvider` for zero-dependency portability.
- **Neural Sizing Engine**: Dynamically calculates node importance based on file size, connectivity, and recency.
- **3D Visualization (Coming Soon)**: A Three.js powered immersive view of the agent's internal thought structure.
- **Semantic Routing**: Allows agents to query the graph for the most relevant "context package" for any given task.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Engine**: TypeScript / Node.js
- **Database**: SQLite (via `better-sqlite3`) or JSON
- **Physics**: D3-force integration
- **Visuals**: Three.js & React-Force-Graph

## 📦 Quick Start
